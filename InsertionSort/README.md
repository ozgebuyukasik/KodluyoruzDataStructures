# Insertion Sort

## a) Steps of the sorting algorithm for [22,27,16,2,18,6]

1- [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6] key = 27

2- [16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6] key = 16

3- [2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6] key = 2

4- [2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6] key = 18

5- [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27] key = 6

## b) Big-O

O(n^2)

## c) Time Complexity

Best: O(n)

Average: O(n^2)

Worst: O(n^2)

## d) After Sorting Which Case Is Suitable For Element 18?

Average case.
